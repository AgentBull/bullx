# RFC 0002: Gateway Inbound + ControlPlane

- **Author**: Boris Ding
- **Created**: 2026-04-22
- **Supersedes**: `rfcs/drafts/Gateway.md` (jointly with RFC 0003)

## 1. TL;DR

BullX Gateway is the OTP-based, durable ingress and egress layer for external messaging. The Gateway answers exactly two questions:

1. *"Something happened in the outside world; how does it become an internal BullX input signal?"*
2. *"Runtime wants to send something outwards; how does it reach the right external channel?"*

This RFC owns the **inbound carrier path** and the **ControlPlane** that durably backs it. The matching egress effects path — `Dispatcher`, `ScopeWorker`, retry / DLQ / replay, outbound dedupe — is owned by RFC 0003. Both RFCs share a single supervision tree, a single ControlPlane, a single content shape, and a single policy pipeline.

Key inbound design:

1. **Single inbound carrier with `event`.** Every inbound event is published as `signal.type = "com.agentbull.x.inbound.received"`. Gateway owns a 7-value semantic axis at `data.event.type` — `message` / `message_edited` / `message_recalled` / `reaction` / `action` / `slash_command` / `trigger` — and derives a `data.duplex` boolean from it (six chat-style types are duplex, `trigger` is not).
2. **Content-first contract.** Every inbound signal carries a non-empty `content` list. There is no top-level summary string. When a source has no native multimodal body (reaction, recall, some action flows), the adapter or Gateway synthesizes a single `text` block. When a source is naturally multimodal, `content` may be image / file / audio / card without any parallel summary field.
3. **Adapter-owned concrete event + Gateway-owned semantic type.** Gateway Core models the carrier and `event.type`; adapters model `event.name` + `event.data` (for example `event.name = "feishu.message.posted"` or `"github.issue.opened"`). Gateway does not enumerate, validate, or interpret adapter event domain fields.
4. **Ack-after-publish dedupe.** Gateway publishes the rendered signal to `Jido.Signal.Bus`, marks `(source, id)` in `gateway_dedupe_seen` (UNLOGGED + ETS hot cache), and then returns to the adapter. A `Bus.publish` failure returns an error so the external source can retry. There is no in-flight persistence of the inbound envelope.
5. **Policy pipeline.** Gateway exposes pluggable `Gating`, `Moderation`, `Security` behaviours, modelled after `jido_messaging`. Defaults are empty. The pipeline order (`Security → Dedupe → Gating → Moderation → Bus publish → mark_seen`) is fixed by Gateway; the modules are supplied by the application.
6. **Flat scope model.** Gateway does not introduce `%Room{}` / `%Participant{}` / `%Thread{}` / `%RoomBinding{}` / `%RoutingPolicy{}`. The flat `{channel, scope_id, thread_id, actor, refs}` shape covers every IM / webhook scenario examined; chat-business aggregation is Runtime's job.

The egress half is summarised at the boundary (see RFC 0003) and only as much as this document needs to define the supervision tree, the `Adapter` behaviour, the Store callbacks, and the policy pipeline.

### 1.1 Cleanup plan

- **Dead code to delete**
  - Delete the placeholder `BullXGateway.CoreSupervisor` once `BullXGateway.CoreSupervisor` and `BullXGateway.AdapterSupervisor` are wired into `BullX.Application`.
  - Delete the old "Gateway boots with zero children" application test assumption; Gateway will now own concrete infrastructure children.
- **Duplicate logic to merge / patterns to reuse**
  - Reuse the existing subsystem supervisor pattern already used by `BullX.Config.Supervisor`, `BullX.Runtime.Supervisor`, `BullXBrain.Supervisor`, and `BullX.Skills.Supervisor`.
  - Reuse `BullX.Repo` + Ecto sandbox for all durable Gateway tests; do not add an ETS-only store variant.
  - Reuse `Jido.Signal` / `Jido.Signal.Bus` directly for the carrier instead of inventing a BullX-local signal envelope or bus abstraction.
- **Actual code paths / processes / schemas changing**
  - Add the inbound Gateway runtime path: `BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound/1` -> `InboundReceived` -> `Security` -> `Deduper` -> `Gating` -> `Moderation` -> `Jido.Signal.Bus.publish/2` -> `Deduper.mark_seen`.
  - Replace the empty Gateway supervisor with `CoreSupervisor` + `AdapterSupervisor` and move application startup order to `Repo -> Config -> Gateway.CoreSupervisor -> Skills -> Brain -> Runtime -> Gateway.AdapterSupervisor -> Endpoint`.
  - Add the inbound durable schema `gateway_dedupe_seen` plus its Ecto wrapper.
- **Invariants that must remain true**
  - Gateway Core still must not model business-domain events or parse `event.data`.
  - Inbound dedupe is `(source, id)` based and `mark_seen` happens only after Bus publish succeeds.
  - `Gateway` code must stay independent of `Plug.Conn`; only `Webhook.RawBodyReader` may touch Plug types.
  - The final published inbound signal must be JSON-neutral, string-keyed, and always carry non-empty `content` plus `event`.
- **Verification commands**
  - `mix test test/bullx/application_test.exs test/bullx_gateway`
  - `mix precommit`

## 2. Position and boundaries

### 2.1 What Gateway Core does

1. Hosts `BullXGateway.SignalBus` (a `Jido.Signal.Bus` instance).
2. Provides `BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound/1`: an adapter constructs one of the seven `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` canonical structs, hands it to Gateway, Gateway renders it into a `%Jido.Signal{}` and publishes.
3. Provides `BullX.Gateway.deliver/1` and `BullX.Gateway.cancel_stream/1` — full semantics in RFC 0003.
4. Provides DLQ ops API `list_dead_letters/1` / `replay_dead_letter/1` — full semantics in RFC 0003.
5. Maintains `AdapterRegistry`, mapping `{adapter, channel_id}` to an adapter module, config, and retry policy.
6. **ControlPlane**: durable writes to `gateway_dedupe_seen` (UNLOGGED, this RFC) and `gateway_dead_letters` (UNLOGGED, RFC 0003). These are the only two Gateway tables.
7. Maintains per-scope `ScopeWorker` processes for outbound serialization (RFC 0003).
8. Performs `(source, id)` inbound dedupe (ETS hot cache + `gateway_dedupe_seen` UNLOGGED backing, per-adapter TTL).
9. Performs `delivery.id` outbound dedupe (RFC 0003).
10. Runs the policy pipeline hooks defined in §6.8.
11. Emits telemetry: publish failed / adapter crashed / queue length / delivery succeeded / failed / pipeline decisions.

### 2.2 What Gateway Core explicitly does not do (cross-cutting non-goals)

- Does not model business events. GitHub issues, Stripe payments, Kafka offsets, market ticks, Feishu domain payloads — all owned by adapters. Gateway transports `event` with opaque `event.data`.
- Does not define a generic `WebhookRequest`, does not enforce a signature framework, does not touch raw body / headers / query / remote IP. The single exception is `BullXGateway.Webhook.RawBodyReader` (§6.6), a body-reader helper.
- Does not own session, turn, memory, knowledge, budget, approval, HITL, cron, subagent, agent orchestration, or "interrupt agent on new message" concurrency. Those belong to Runtime.
- Does not introduce `%Room{}` / `%Participant{}` / `%Thread{}` / `%RoomBinding{}` / `%RoutingPolicy{}`. No thread lifecycle, participant registry, presence, or typing.
- Does not model platform-specific semantics like `ModalClose` or `AssistantThreadStarted`.
- Does not maintain media long-term storage or a unified media cache; adapters handle that.
- Does not filter think-blocks or reasoning content (Runtime).
- Does not enumerate `failure_class` / retry taxonomy as a protocol contract. `error.kind` is supplied by adapters; Runtime decides retry semantics for itself.
- Does not perform cross-node routing, distributed bus, or global consistency.
- Does not perform audit-grade rejection persistence (rejections go to telemetry only).
- Does not attempt mid-stream durability (only the `stream_close` outcome is durable; see RFC 0003).
- Does not ship default Gating / Moderation / Security implementations; the application layer provides them.

### 2.3 Inbound-focused do / don't

**Do (this RFC):**

- Render canonical `%Jido.Signal{}` envelopes with the `content + event` contract.
- Validate carrier shape, never event-domain semantics.
- Record `(source, id)` dedupe in `gateway_dedupe_seen` only after a successful Bus publish.
- Run the inbound policy pipeline (`Security → Dedupe → Gating → Moderation → Bus publish → mark_seen`).
- Return `{:error, {:bus_publish_failed, _}}` on Bus errors so the external source can retry.

**Don't (this RFC):**

- Don't validate `event.data` field-by-field.
- Don't whitelist `event.name` values.
- Don't persist a per-event audit row for rejections or in-flight signals — `Security` / `Gating` / `Moderation` denials and Bus-publish failures live in telemetry and the synchronous return value only. The external source retries on error; a successful retry publishes normally.
- Don't introduce a BullX-user-system identity slot on `actor`; Runtime maps `actor.id` to business identity when needed.
- Don't subscribe to the Bus with persistent / ack-checkpointing semantics; the carrier is pure publish / subscribe.

## 3. Design constraints

The eleven constraints that frame the Gateway design as a whole:

1. **Single node.** No cross-node routing, no distributed bus, no global consistency.
2. **PostgreSQL is required.** Gateway uses `BullX.Repo` (PostgreSQL) for dedupe backing and the DLQ. Both Gateway tables (`gateway_dedupe_seen`, `gateway_dead_letters`) are `UNLOGGED` — their loss on unclean server crash is recoverable (external sources retry; Runtime + Oban re-dispatches outbound). dev / test go through the Ecto sandbox; no ETS-only backend is maintained.
3. **Process isolation.** A single channel / scope / listener failure must not propagate to the rest of Gateway.
4. **New channel = incremental extension.** Adding an adapter must not change the Gateway Core protocol or the supervision tree skeleton.
5. **Inbound uses `Jido.Signal`.** No second event envelope is invented.
6. **Outbound uses a separate `BullXGateway.Delivery` struct.** Inbound and outbound are not stuffed into one type.
7. **Bus routing is by `signal.type` pattern.** `Jido.Signal.Bus.subscribe/3` is the real semantics; there is no parallel topic-PubSub.
8. **`time` is an ISO8601 string; `specversion` must be exactly `"1.0.2"`.** See Appendix A.
9. **Gateway-produced signals prefer the external stable event id as `signal.id`.** When omitted, `Jido.Signal.new/1` generates a UUID7.
10. **No persistent / ack-checkpoint Bus subscriptions.** Plain publish / subscribe only; durability is the ControlPlane's responsibility.
11. **Startup order is the ingress gate.** There is no `IngressControl` on/off switch. The application starts `BullXGateway.AdapterSupervisor` only after `BullX.Runtime.Supervisor` is ready. Even when Runtime is late, durable ControlPlane buffers events, so nothing is lost.

## 4. Internal event protocol

### 4.1 Signal type list

Gateway Core defines exactly **three** stable carrier `signal.type` values:

```text
com.agentbull.x.inbound.received     # all inbound (chat / edits / recalls / reactions / actions / slash / triggers)
com.agentbull.x.delivery.succeeded   # outbound success (RFC 0003)
com.agentbull.x.delivery.failed      # outbound failure (RFC 0003)
```

Adding a new external source or event subtype does not add a new carrier type. Adapters express variation through `data.event.type` (the Gateway-owned semantic axis) and `data.event.name` (the adapter-owned concrete event name).

**Carrier type vs. semantic type.** These are different axes living in different slots:

- `signal.type` (CloudEvents envelope, top-level) — the **carrier** type. Three stable values only (`inbound.received`, `delivery.succeeded`, `delivery.failed`). Used by Bus subscription globs.
- `signal.data["event"]["type"]` — the **semantic** type of the inbound interaction. Seven values. Used by Runtime to branch on what *kind* of thing happened.
- `signal.data["event"]["name"]` — the adapter-owned **concrete event name**. Used by Runtime / skills to dispatch on platform specifics.

Subscribers should never switch on `signal.type` to distinguish `"message"` vs `"reaction"` — that's what `data.event.type` is for.

This RFC owns `com.agentbull.x.inbound.received`. The two `delivery.*` types are produced by the egress path defined in RFC 0003; the carrier name and Bus subscription pattern are introduced here so the Bus contract is complete from one document.

Bus subscription example:

```elixir
# Runtime subscribes to all inbound signals
Jido.Signal.Bus.subscribe(
  BullXGateway.SignalBus,
  "com.agentbull.x.inbound.**",
  dispatch: {:pid, target: runtime_dispatcher}
)

# The handler dispatches by data.event.type:
fn signal ->
  case get_in(signal.data, ["event", "type"]) do
    "message"          -> handle_chat_message(signal)
    "message_edited"   -> handle_message_edit(signal)
    "message_recalled" -> handle_message_recall(signal)
    "reaction"         -> handle_reaction(signal)
    "action"           -> handle_card_action(signal)
    "slash_command"    -> handle_slash(signal)
    "trigger"          -> handle_webhook(signal)
  end
end

# Outbound result subscription (RFC 0003 produces these)
Jido.Signal.Bus.subscribe(
  BullXGateway.SignalBus,
  "com.agentbull.x.delivery.**",
  dispatch: {:pid, target: runtime_delivery_watcher}
)
```

### 4.2 Content + event contract

**Every inbound signal's `data` is a Gateway-rendered canonical payload, not a verbatim mirror of the `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` struct the adapter submitted.**

The two required projections are:

| Field | Audience | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | LLM / Agent / human-readable projection | Canonical multimodal content blocks, **required, non-empty**. If the source has no native body, the adapter or Gateway synthesizes a single `text` block. |
| `event` | Machine routing / tool calls / audit | Structured fact, **required**. Shape: `%{"type" => "<gateway semantic type>", "name" => "<adapter>.<event>", "version" => 1, "data" => %{...}}`. |

Other stable inbound fields (full shape in §4.6 / §4.7):

- `duplex` — boolean, derived from `event.type` (six chat-style types are `true`, `trigger` is `false`).
- `actor` — `%{id, display, bot}`; all three required. Runtime maps `actor.id` to any BullX-user-system identity when needed.
- `refs` — list of stable anchors `[%{kind, id, url?}]`, defaults to `[]`.
- `reply_channel` — only present when `duplex = true`: `%{adapter, channel_id, scope_id, thread_id?}`. Omitted (or `nil`) when `duplex = false`.
- Type-specific fields (§4.3).

`BullXGateway.Inputs.*` are internal Elixir structs the adapter passes to Gateway; they may use atom keys. When rendering the `%Jido.Signal{}`, Gateway must canonicalize:

1. Recursively normalize map keys from atom / mixed-key to string-key.
2. Project values that the protocol requires to be JSON-friendly into strings (e.g. `content.kind`, `Outcome.status`, `reaction.action :: :added | :removed` to `"added"` / `"removed"`).
3. Validate that the final `%Jido.Signal{}`'s `data` and `extensions` are JSON-neutral (no atoms, no `DateTime`, no structs, no functions).

Data flow:

```text
External raw payload
  -> Adapter-private parser / verifier (HMAC / JWT / timestamp window / ...)
  -> Adapter-owned typed event struct (e.g. GitHub.Events.IssueOpened, optional)
  -> Adapter produces projections:
       1. content          (adapter-chosen logic; or Gateway default for a few semantic types)
       2. event            (adapter-chosen name/version/data; semantic type implied by Input struct)
       3. refs / actor / type-specific fields
  -> One of BullXGateway.Inputs.* canonical structs (one of seven)
  -> BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound(input)
  -> Gateway pipeline: Security -> Dedupe -> Gating -> Moderation -> durable write -> Bus.publish
  -> Runtime / skill receives Signal with content + event
```

### 4.3 Event types (seven canonical structs)

Gateway defines seven canonical semantic event types under `BullXGateway.Inputs.*`. Adapters must map every external event to one of them. The classification follows generic IM semantics, not any single platform's API.

| Type | Gateway struct | `data.event.type` | duplex | Typical sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chat new message (text + media) | `BullXGateway.Inputs.Message` | `"message"` | true | Feishu / Slack / Discord message posted |
| Message edited | `BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageEdited` | `"message_edited"` | true | Feishu `im.message.updated_v1`, Slack `message_changed`, Discord `MESSAGE_UPDATE` |
| Message recalled | `BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageRecalled` | `"message_recalled"` | true | Feishu `im.message.recalled_v1`, etc. |
| Emoji reaction add / remove | `BullXGateway.Inputs.Reaction` | `"reaction"` | true | Feishu / Slack / Discord reaction |
| Interactive component (button / form / modal submit) | `BullXGateway.Inputs.Action` | `"action"` | true | Feishu card button, Slack `view_submission`, ... |
| Slash command | `BullXGateway.Inputs.SlashCommand` | `"slash_command"` | true | `/help`, `/status`, ... |
| Non-chat event (webhook / polling / feed / tick) | `BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger` | `"trigger"` | false | GitHub webhook, Stripe webhook, market tick |

**Deliberately not separate types:**

- **Modal submit** is not a separate type — semantically it is a form submit, a special `Action` (payload contains form values). Adapters use `event.name = "slack.view_submission"` / `"feishu.card.form_submit"` to distinguish platform subtypes; the protocol treats it as `Action`.
- **Modal close / dismiss** is not modelled — Slack-specific, weak semantics, Runtime almost never needs to respond. An adapter that insists may carry it as `Action` (`event.name = "slack.view_closed"`); not recommended.
- **Assistant thread started / context changed** (jido_chat has it) is not modelled — Slack Assistant Panel-specific integration; BullX has no use today; add when needed.
- **The message lifecycle triplet** (`Message` / `MessageEdited` / `MessageRecalled`) is intentional — most IM platforms support these natively, and editing one's own message is a daily occurrence.

### 4.4 Identity and dedupe

`(source, id)` is the primary idempotency contract.

- `source` is a stable adapter instance URI:
  - `bullx://gateway/feishu/default`
  - `bullx://gateway/github/default`
- `id` prefers the external stable event id:
  - Feishu event id;
  - GitHub delivery id (`X-GitHub-Delivery`);
  - When one external delivery is split into multiple internal signals, the adapter derives stable child ids: `<delivery_id>#0`, `<delivery_id>#1`;
  - For reactions / edits / recalls without a native id, adapters synthesize a stable id: `"#{event_type}:#{target_message_id}:#{actor_id}:#{action_time}"`.

Adapters may perform stateful normalization on raw events (re-aggregate split-and-reassembled chunks, merge album batches, drop bot self-echo). Gateway Core only requires that the final per-signal `(source, id)` pair satisfy the idempotency contract.

The `Deduper`'s ETS hot cache is a performance optimization. The authoritative source is `gateway_dedupe_seen` (UNLOGGED with a unique index). A `mark_seen` call only happens after a successful `Bus.publish`, so a Bus failure leaves no dedupe trace and the external source's retry can still make it through.

### 4.5 `Jido.Signal` envelope

```elixir
%Jido.Signal{
  specversion: "1.0.2",
  id: "evt_...",                      # external stable event id (dedupe primary key source)
  source: "bullx://gateway/feishu/default",
  type: "com.agentbull.x.inbound.received"
       | "com.agentbull.x.delivery.succeeded"
       | "com.agentbull.x.delivery.failed",
  subject: "feishu:chat_abc",         # human-readable / log display only
  time: "2026-04-21T10:00:00Z",
  datacontenttype: "application/json",
  data: %{...},                       # see §4.6
  extensions: %{
    "bullx_channel_adapter" => "feishu",          # required
    "bullx_channel_id"      => "default",         # required
    "bullx_caused_by"       => "<source inbound id>"  # optional (delivery.* often present, inbound rarely)
    # Optional policy pipeline extension keys (§6.8):
    # "bullx_security"             => %{...}
    # "bullx_flags"                => [%{stage, module, reason, description}, ...]
    # "bullx_moderation_modified"  => true
  }
}
```

Constraints:

- `type` / `source` / `id` / `subject` / `time` are strings.
- `data` and `extensions` are JSON-neutral (string keys, no atoms / `DateTime` / structs / functions).
- `subject` is for logs / UI / debugging only. **Machine logic must not parse `subject`.** Routing reads `extensions` or `data`.
- `extensions` carries only **envelope-level provenance**: the three fixed keys plus optional policy extension keys (§6.8). Business payload (`scope_id`, `thread_id`, `actor`, ...) is read from `data`, not duplicated into `extensions`.

### 4.6 Inbound payload examples (`com.agentbull.x.inbound.received`)

All inbound events share this single carrier. `data.event.type` determines the type-specific shape; `data.event.name` preserves the adapter-specific concrete event name; `data.duplex` determines whether reverse writes are possible.

**Example 1: Feishu group chat message (`event.type = "message"`)**

```elixir
%Jido.Signal{
  id: "om_abc123",
  source: "bullx://gateway/feishu/default",
  type: "com.agentbull.x.inbound.received",
  subject: "feishu:oc_xxx",
  time: "2026-04-21T10:00:00Z",
  datacontenttype: "application/json",
  data: %{
    "duplex" => true,

    # Flat scope contract (shared across all semantic types;
    # the same fields appear inside reply_channel for duplex types):
    "scope_id" => "oc_xxx",
    "thread_id" => nil,

    "content" => [
      %{"kind" => "text", "body" => %{"text" => "please summarize today's GitHub issues"}}
    ],

    "event" => %{
      "type" => "message",
      "name" => "feishu.message.posted",
      "version" => 1,
      "data" => %{
        "message_id" => "om_abc123",
        "chat_id" => "oc_xxx",
        "chat_type" => "group",
        "message_type" => "text",
        "mentions" => [],
        "reply_to_message_id" => nil
      }
    },

    "actor" => %{
      "id" => "feishu:user_xxx",
      "display" => "Boris",
      "bot" => false
    },

    "refs" => [
      %{"kind" => "feishu.message", "id" => "om_abc123"},
      %{"kind" => "feishu.chat",    "id" => "oc_xxx"}
    ],

    "reply_channel" => %{
      "adapter" => "feishu",
      "channel_id" => "default",
      "scope_id" => "oc_xxx",
      "thread_id" => nil
    }
    # Message has no extra type-specific required fields.
  },
  extensions: %{
    "bullx_channel_adapter" => "feishu",
    "bullx_channel_id"      => "default"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `content` is the canonical content slot. If a message has images / files / audio, the adapter appends the corresponding blocks in original order (`image` / `file` / `audio`) instead of hiding them inside `event.data`.
- `content` is the preferred model / human-readable projection. There is no parallel top-level summary field.
- `event.type` is Gateway-owned; `event.name` is adapter-defined. Under one `event.type = "message"` you might see `"feishu.message.text"`, `"feishu.message.file"`, `"slack.message.shared"`, ... Gateway Core does not enumerate or validate these.
- `event.version` is for adapter-internal schema evolution; Gateway only verifies it exists and is an integer.
- `refs` gives Runtime / tools stable anchors so they need not parse text.
- `reply_channel` lets Runtime build a Delivery; required when `duplex = true`.

**Example 2: GitHub issue opened webhook (`event.type = "trigger"`)**

```elixir
%Jido.Signal{
  id: "8f7fdc1d-...",                              # GitHub delivery id
  source: "bullx://gateway/github/default",
  type: "com.agentbull.x.inbound.received",
  subject: "github:acme/api",
  time: "2026-04-21T10:00:00Z",
  datacontenttype: "application/json",
  data: %{
    "duplex" => false,

    # trigger has no reply_channel, but scope_id / thread_id are still required:
    "scope_id" => "acme/api",
    "thread_id" => nil,

    "content" => [
      %{
        "kind" => "text",
        "body" => %{
          "text" =>
            "GitHub repo acme/api has a new issue #101: Database latency spike\n" <>
            "URL: https://github.com/acme/api/issues/101\n" <>
            "by octocat"
        }
      }
    ],

    "event" => %{
      "type" => "trigger",
      "name" => "github.issue.opened",
      "version" => 1,
      "data" => %{
        "repository" => "acme/api",
        "issue_number" => 101,
        "issue_title" => "Database latency spike",
        "issue_url" => "https://github.com/acme/api/issues/101",
        "sender_login" => "octocat"
      }
    },

    "actor" => %{
      "id" => "github:octocat",
      "display" => "octocat",
      "bot" => false
    },

    "refs" => [
      %{"kind" => "github.repo",  "id" => "acme/api",
        "url" => "https://github.com/acme/api"},
      %{"kind" => "github.issue", "id" => "acme/api#101",
        "url" => "https://github.com/acme/api/issues/101"}
    ]
    # duplex = false: reply_channel omitted.
  },
  extensions: %{
    "bullx_channel_adapter" => "github",
    "bullx_channel_id"      => "default"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Gateway does not know what a GitHub issue is; it carries `event.data` as an opaque map.
- Trigger still carries `content`. In the common webhook case that means a single synthesized `text` block; if a trigger has richer native body (comment body, attachments, chart snapshot), the adapter emits that richer content directly.
- No `reply_channel`: to respond (e.g. comment on the issue), Runtime must call the GitHub tool / action that hits the GitHub API directly. Gateway `deliver/1` does not apply.
- `refs` is the stable anchor list for tool calls; skills do not regex-parse `content` text to extract `acme/api#101`.
- `scope_id = "acme/api"` is an adapter-defined aggregation key (repo level). A Shopify adapter might use `"shop_id:order"`; a Kafka adapter might use `"topic:partition"`. Gateway does not interpret `scope_id`'s internal structure.
- When the external source has no natural actor (market tick, polling feed, system alert), the adapter must supply a synthetic actor: `%{"id" => "system:market-feed", "display" => "Market Feed", "bot" => true}`.

**Example 3: emoji reaction (`event.type = "reaction"`)**

```

### 4.7 Event granularity guidelines

**The event model is not the external platform's full schema. It is the minimal stable projection that Runtime / tools / operators need.**

- Do not stuff an entire GitHub webhook payload into `event.data` — pick the fields Runtime will actually use (repo, issue number, title, URL, sender).
- Do not relay all 100+ Stripe fields — pick the ones the business cares about (amount, currency, customer_id, payment_intent_id).
- One external event may map to multiple `event.name` values (e.g. GitHub `pull_request` events split by `action` into `github.pull_request.opened` / `github.pull_request.merged`).
- Conversely, one `event.name` may aggregate multiple external events (e.g. the market adapter coalesces 1 second of ticks into one `market.tick.received`).
- `event.version` is for adapter-owned schema evolution. v1 -> v2 should preserve backward compatibility or break explicitly; the adapter's RFC owns that policy.
- **`event.type` is Gateway's; `event.name` is the adapter's.** Two layers of projection, with clean separation. Runtime can dispatch on both (coarse by `event.type`, fine by `event.name`).

A sizing rule of thumb (inspired by jido_integration's devops proof): a handler that needs `repository` / `issue_number` / `issue_title` from `event.data` already has enough to do incident routing ("page oncall"); it does not need the entire GitHub payload.

### 4.8 `subject` and `extensions`

**`subject`** is a human-readable aggregation key string:

```text
<adapter>:<scope>[:<thread>]
```

Examples: `feishu:oc_xxx`, `feishu:oc_xxx:topic_12`, `github:acme/api`.

**Machine logic must not parse `subject`.** Routing, cache keys, tool arguments must read `data` or `extensions`.

**`extensions`** carries only envelope-level provenance — the three fixed keys:

```elixir
%{
  "bullx_channel_adapter" => "feishu" | "github" | "slack" | ...,  # required
  "bullx_channel_id"      => "default",                             # required
  "bullx_caused_by"       => "<source inbound signal id>"           # optional (delivery.* often)
}
```

Optional policy pipeline extension keys (§6.8):

- `"bullx_security"` — metadata returned by `Security.verify_sender` (when the adapter chooses to populate it);
- `"bullx_flags"` — `[%{"stage", "module", "reason", "description"}, ...]`, accumulated by `Moderation`;
- `"bullx_moderation_modified"` — `true` when at least one moderator returned `:modify`.

**`scope_id` and `thread_id` are not put in `extensions`** (they live in `data`). Routing uses `signal.type`; `extensions` is provenance / audit only.

**There is no `bullx_scope_kind`** (`"dm" | "group" | "channel"`). Forcing webhook sources to pretend to be chat scopes only creates semantic pollution. `dm` / `group` / `channel` / `repo` / `feed` are adapter-internal semantics (and may live in `event.data.chat_type` for example); Gateway Core need not understand them.

Bot-self-echo filtering and bot-message identification are adapter responsibilities; the adapter drops them internally. No dedicated extension flag exists.

**Actor identity.** `actor.id` stably identifies the sender; Runtime maps it to business identity when needed.

### 4.9 Typed signal modules

The Gateway defines exactly **three** typed signal modules, each with `new/1` and `new!/1`:

- `BullXGateway.Signals.InboundReceived`
- `BullXGateway.Signals.DeliverySucceeded` (RFC 0003)
- `BullXGateway.Signals.DeliveryFailed` (RFC 0003)

`InboundReceived.new/1` contract:

```elixir
@type input ::
        BullXGateway.Inputs.Message.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageEdited.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageRecalled.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.Reaction.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.Action.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.SlashCommand.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger.t()

@spec new(input()) :: {:ok, Jido.Signal.t()} | {:error, term()}
```

#### Inbound carrier validation: carrier only

`BullXGateway.Inputs.*` may arrive at `InboundReceived.new/1` as internal atom-key structs. The first step canonicalizes; the second step validates the final signal payload.

**Validation steps** (executed in order):

1. **Top level:** `type` is exactly `"com.agentbull.x.inbound.received"`; `source`, `id`, `time` are non-empty; `specversion = "1.0.2"`.
2. **JSON projection:** `data` and `extensions` are string-key JSON-neutral maps.
3. **Extensions provenance:** `bullx_channel_adapter` and `bullx_channel_id` exist and are non-empty; optional keys are validated when present.
4. **Event projection:** `data.event` is `%{"type" => _, "name" => _, "version" => _, "data" => _}` where:
   - `data.event.type` is one of the seven allowed values.
   - `data.event.name` is a non-empty string (the value is not checked against any whitelist).
   - `data.event.version` is an integer.
   - `data.event.data` is a map (may be `%{}`, but must be a map).
   - `data.duplex` is a boolean and consistent with `event.type` (six chat types `true`, `trigger` `false`).
5. **Content projection:**
   - `data.content` is a non-empty list of `%{"kind" => kind_string, "body" => map}`.
   - `data.content[].kind` is one of the six stable kinds: `"text" | "image" | "audio" | "video" | "file" | "card"`.
   - For non-`"text"` kinds, `content.body["fallback_text"]` is a required non-empty string (the only hard contract in §5.2).
   - If an Input arrives without natural content for a semantic type that Gateway knows how to render (`reaction`, `message_recalled`, `action`, `slash_command`), the render step may synthesize one `text` block before validation. Validation still only sees the final non-empty signal payload.
6. **Stable fields:**
   - **`data.scope_id`** is required and a non-empty string. All semantic types share it; the inbound carrier surfaces it at the top of `data` (not only inside `reply_channel`).
   - **`data.thread_id`** is a required key whose value may be `nil` or a non-empty string. All semantic types must include the key; the value is adapter-decided.
   - `data.actor` is exactly `%{"id" => non_empty_string, "display" => non_empty_string, "bot" => bool}`. The non-empty `display` is a hard contract because it is the only actor field surfaced to LLM / operator-facing text (default templates, rendered `content`).
   - `data.refs` is a list of `%{"kind" => _, "id" => _, "url" => _ | nil}`; defaults to `[]`.
   - When `duplex = true`, `data.reply_channel` is required: `%{"adapter" => _, "channel_id" => _, "scope_id" => _, "thread_id" => _ | nil}`. Its `scope_id` / `thread_id` should match the top-level `data.scope_id` / `data.thread_id` (redundant but lets Runtime build a Delivery without crossing fields).
   - When `duplex = false`, `data.reply_channel` is omitted or `nil`; the top-level `data.scope_id` / `data.thread_id` are still required.
7. **Type-specific:** see §4.3 struct fields. For example, `Reaction` requires `target_external_message_id`, `emoji`, `action ∈ {"added", "removed"}`; `MessageEdited` requires `target_external_message_id`; `Action` requires `target_external_message_id` and `action_id`; etc.

**Not validated:**

- The specific value of `event.name` (no allowed-value whitelist).
- Field-level shape of `event.data` (Gateway does not know what a GitHub issue contains).
- `content.body` beyond the §5.2 minimum carrier contract (e.g. card payload schema).
- `refs[].kind` whitelist.
- The textual format of a synthesized `text` content block.

This is exactly what **"Gateway validates the carrier, not the event"** means in practice.

#### Usage constraint

**Adapters and Runtime must not bypass the typed signal module by constructing `%Jido.Signal{}` and calling `Bus.publish/2` directly for inbound.** The inbound path must go through `BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound/1`, which internally calls `InboundReceived.new/1`. If rendering or validation fails, `publish_inbound/1` returns `{:error, reason}` and the signal does not enter the Bus.

`new!/1` is the fast path for already-clean inputs (raises on failure).

The two outbound result signal modules (`DeliverySucceeded`, `DeliveryFailed`) are defined in RFC 0003.

## 5. Content body shape (shared)

This RFC owns the authoritative definition of `BullXGateway.Delivery.Content`'s body shape because the same shape is used by inbound `data["content"][]` blocks. RFC 0003 references this section without redefining it.

```elixir
defmodule BullXGateway.Delivery.Content do
  @type kind :: :text | :image | :audio | :video | :file | :card
  @type t :: %__MODULE__{kind: kind(), body: map()}
end
```

Once a `Content.kind` enters the Gateway protocol it must satisfy a minimum `body` contract. The contract applies both to outbound `BullXGateway.Delivery.Content` and to inbound `data["content"][]` canonical blocks (inbound blocks project `kind` to a string).

**Minimum body shape** (every non-`:text` kind must include `fallback_text` as a non-empty string — this is the **only hard contract** Gateway enforces, it underwrites every degradation path):

- `:text` — `%{"text" => String.t()}`.
- `:image` — `%{"url" => String.t(), "fallback_text" => String.t(), "media_type" => String.t() | nil, "alt_text" => String.t() | nil, "width" => non_neg_integer() | nil, "height" => non_neg_integer() | nil, "size_bytes" => non_neg_integer() | nil}`.
- `:audio` — `%{"url" => String.t(), "fallback_text" => String.t(), "media_type" => String.t() | nil, "duration" => non_neg_integer() | nil, "transcript" => String.t() | nil, "size_bytes" => non_neg_integer() | nil}`.
- `:video` — `%{"url" => String.t(), "fallback_text" => String.t(), "media_type" => String.t() | nil, "duration" => non_neg_integer() | nil, "width" => non_neg_integer() | nil, "height" => non_neg_integer() | nil, "thumbnail_url" => String.t() | nil, "size_bytes" => non_neg_integer() | nil}`.
- `:file` — `%{"url" => String.t(), "fallback_text" => String.t(), "filename" => String.t() | nil, "media_type" => String.t() | nil, "size_bytes" => non_neg_integer() | nil}`.
- `:card` — `%{"format" => String.t(), "payload" => map(), "fallback_text" => String.t()}`.

The shape is "**`kind` enum + `body` is a map + non-text kinds have `fallback_text`**" plus an agreed-on shape for the rest (consumers that cannot read a field fall back to `fallback_text`). Additional fields are allowed.

**Single `url` URI field.** The previous design separated `url` (HTTP) from `data` (data URI). This RFC merges them into a single `url`: the string itself is a URI, supporting any scheme — `https://cdn.example.com/xxx.png` (external) or `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...` (inline data URI). Both are URIs, splitting them serves no purpose. Consumers dispatch by URI scheme. The field is **required, non-empty**. The `path` option is removed: Gateway does not abstract local-file access; an adapter holding local bytes must upload to a URL or encode as a data URI before populating `url`.

**No max-size cap.** Sizing is the adapter author's responsibility. Large files must be uploaded to an external store and referenced by an HTTP(S) URL; multi-megabyte data URIs in a Signal are not allowed. The reasoning: a cap inside Gateway would either be too low for some legitimate adapter (forcing a workaround) or too high to provide real protection. Adapters know their platform's payload limits and own the decision.

This is only the minimum delivery contract; it is not a unified media cache. Adapters remain responsible for magic-byte detection, upload / download, platform limits, chunking, native fallback, and platform-private card schemas.

## 6. Channel and adapter

### 6.1 Channel identity and registration

**A channel is identified by `{adapter_atom, channel_id_string}`.** `channel_id` is the per-binding string that distinguishes different logical channels sharing the same adapter module. The concept exists so a single adapter type can serve multiple concrete external sources in the same node — e.g. one `:github` adapter module bound once per repository, one `:slack` or `:feishu` adapter bound once per external workspace — each registered under a distinct `channel_id` with its own config, credentials, and retry policy.

Examples: `{:feishu, "default"}`, `{:feishu, "acme_workspace"}`, `{:github, "acme/api"}`, `{:github, "acme/web"}`.

Adapter modules do not declare channels statically via `channel/0`; the `channel_id` is per-instance configuration, not a module-level static attribute. Runtime code should normally start a channel through `BullXGateway.AdapterSupervisor.start_channel/3`, which owns the adapter subtree lifecycle, registers the channel, and stores the channel-supervisor pid as `config.anchor_pid` for `ScopeWorker` monitoring:

```elixir
BullXGateway.AdapterSupervisor.start_channel(
  {:feishu, "default"},
  BullXGateway.Adapters.Feishu,
  config
)
```

`BullXGateway.AdapterRegistry.register/3` remains a narrow registry API for tests and manually supervised adapters. It does not start adapter children and does not synthesize `anchor_pid`.

`config` shape (Gateway-shared metadata + adapter-specific fields):

```elixir
%{
  # shared metadata (read by Gateway)
  dedupe_ttl_ms: 5 * 60 * 1000,              # per-adapter dedupe TTL
  retry_policy: %{                            # outbound retry policy (RFC 0003)
    max_attempts: 5,
    base_backoff_ms: 1000,
    max_backoff_ms: 30_000
  },

  # adapter-specific (read by the adapter)
  app_id: "cli_xxx",
  app_secret: "xxx",                          # credential management is in BullX.Config (RFC 0001)
  ...
}
```

### 6.2 The `BullXGateway.Adapter` behaviour

Adapters are registered and started under the supervision tree owned by this RFC, so the **full** behaviour definition lives here. Egress call-contract details (when ScopeWorker calls `deliver/2` / `stream/3`, retry semantics, etc.) are spelled out in RFC 0003.

```elixir
defmodule BullXGateway.Adapter do
  @type context :: %{
          required(:channel) => BullX.Delivery.channel(),
          required(:config) => map(),
          required(:telemetry) => map(),
          optional(atom()) => term()
        }

  # op capabilities — correspond to BullX.Delivery.op(); used by Gateway deliver/1 pre-check
  @type op_capability :: :send | :edit | :stream
  # metadata capabilities — adapter self-description for UI / Runtime reference; not used in pre-check
  @type metadata_capability :: :reactions | :cards | :threads | atom()
  @type capability :: op_capability() | metadata_capability()

  @callback adapter_id() :: atom()

  @callback child_specs(channel :: BullX.Delivery.channel(), config :: map()) ::
              [Supervisor.child_spec()]

  @callback deliver(BullX.Delivery.t(), context()) ::
              {:ok, BullXGateway.Delivery.Outcome.adapter_success_t()} | {:error, map()}

  @callback stream(BullX.Delivery.t(), Enumerable.t(), context()) ::
              {:ok, BullXGateway.Delivery.Outcome.adapter_success_t()} | {:error, map()}

  # capabilities/0 is required: Gateway deliver/1 pre-check depends on it
  @callback capabilities() :: [capability()]

  @optional_callbacks [
    child_specs: 2,
    deliver: 2,
    stream: 3
  ]
end
```

Callback contract:

- `adapter_id/0` **required**: module's static identity (atom).
- `child_specs/2` **optional**: the adapter starts its own listener / WebSocket / polling / webhook server / signature verifier / rate limiter / token manager. Gateway hangs them under `AdapterSupervisor`.
- `context` contains at least `%{channel, config, telemetry}`; additional fields are allowed (e.g. an anchor pid for the adapter subtree, so ScopeWorker can `Process.monitor` it).
- `deliver/2` **optional**: handles `:send` and `:edit` ops. The adapter must declare the matching op in `capabilities/0`.
- `stream/3` **optional**: handles `:stream`, consuming an `Enumerable.t()`. The adapter must declare `:stream` in `capabilities/0`.
- `capabilities/0` **required**: part of the adapter contract. Gateway `deliver/1` pre-check (RFC 0003) depends on it. Pure inbound adapters (e.g. GitHub webhook) return `[]`.

**Two capability semantics, kept separate:**

1. **Op capabilities** (`:send | :edit | :stream`) correspond one-to-one with `BullX.Delivery.op()`. Gateway `deliver/1` pre-check looks at exactly these three: when the adapter has not declared the requested op, the pre-check publishes `delivery.failed{error.kind = "unsupported"}` and writes a DLQ entry (RFC 0003).
2. **Metadata capabilities** (`:reactions | :cards | :threads | ...`) are adapter self-descriptions intended for UI / Runtime / skill **reference**. **Gateway does not use them in pre-check.** For example, when Runtime sends `Delivery{op: :send, content: %{kind: :card, ...}}` to an adapter that declared only `[:send]` (and not `:cards`), Gateway still routes the delivery to `ScopeWorker` and `deliver/2`. The adapter degrades by rendering `content.body["fallback_text"]` as plain text (§6.7). **A `:send` is rejected only when `:send` itself is missing from capabilities, not when `:cards` is missing.**

Examples:

```elixir
def capabilities, do: [:send, :edit, :stream, :reactions, :cards]

def deliver(%Delivery{op: :send} = d, ctx), do: ...
def deliver(%Delivery{op: :edit} = d, ctx), do: ...

def stream(%Delivery{op: :stream} = d, enumerable, ctx), do: ...
```

Adapter that doesn't support a particular op (e.g. Discord-only adapter without `:stream`):

```elixir
def capabilities, do: [:send, :edit]            # :stream omitted
def deliver(%Delivery{op: :send} = d, ctx), do: ...
def deliver(%Delivery{op: :edit} = d, ctx), do: ...
# stream/3 not implemented; Gateway pre-check rejects op: :stream deliveries
```

Pure inbound adapter:

```elixir
def capabilities, do: []                        # no outbound capability
# deliver/2 / stream/3 not implemented; any Delivery fails pre-check
```

A missing callback combined with a missing capability declaration means **the adapter does not support the corresponding op**. Gateway pre-check uses `capabilities/0` and never relies on `function_exported?` to decide.

### 6.3 `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` — the seven canonical input structs

An adapter listener constructs one of seven canonical structs and hands it to Gateway; Gateway renders the `%Jido.Signal{}` and publishes.

**Shared fields (every semantic type):**

```elixir
%{
  id: String.t(),                       # external stable event id; becomes signal.id
  source: String.t(),                   # adapter instance URI
  subject: String.t() | nil,            # optional; Gateway derives "<adapter>:<scope>[:<thread>]" if omitted
  time: DateTime.t() | nil,             # optional; Gateway writes utc_now if omitted
  channel: BullX.Delivery.channel(),    # {adapter, channel_id}
  scope_id: String.t(),
  thread_id: String.t() | nil,
  actor: %{
    id: String.t(),                     # required, platform identity
    display: String.t(),
    bot: boolean()
  },
  content: [content_block] | nil,
  refs: [%{kind: String.t(), id: String.t(), url: String.t() | nil}],
  event: %{
    name: String.t(),
    version: non_neg_integer(),
    data: map()
  },
  reply_channel: %{                     # only for duplex = true types
    adapter: atom(),
    channel_id: String.t(),
    scope_id: String.t(),
    thread_id: String.t() | nil
  } | nil
}
```

`event.type` is implied by the concrete `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` struct. The adapter supplies only the adapter-owned `event.name` / `event.version` / `event.data`; Gateway renders the semantic `event.type` into the final signal.

**Type-specific fields:**

- `BullXGateway.Inputs.Message`: `content :: [content_block]` is required; `reply_to_external_id :: String.t() | nil`; `mentions :: [%{actor_id, offset_range}] | nil`.
- `BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageEdited`: `target_external_message_id :: String.t()`; `content :: [content_block]` (the updated body) is required; `edited_at :: DateTime.t() | nil`.
- `BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageRecalled`: `target_external_message_id :: String.t()`; `recalled_by_actor :: actor() | nil` (may differ from top-level actor); `recalled_at :: DateTime.t() | nil`. `content` may be supplied by the adapter or rendered by Gateway as a single `text` block (`"<recaller.display> recalled a message"`, where `recaller = recalled_by_actor || actor`).
- `BullXGateway.Inputs.Reaction`: `target_external_message_id :: String.t()`; `emoji :: String.t()`; `action :: :added | :removed`. `content` may be supplied by the adapter or template-defaulted by Gateway when omitted.
- `BullXGateway.Inputs.Action`: `target_external_message_id :: String.t()`, `action_id :: String.t()`, `values :: map()` (opaque — button value, form values, modal submit payload, ...).
- `BullXGateway.Inputs.SlashCommand`: `command_name :: String.t()`, `args :: String.t()`, `reply_to_external_id :: String.t() | nil`. `content` may be supplied by the adapter or rendered by Gateway as one `text` block from `"/#{command_name} #{args}"`.
- `BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger`: `content :: [content_block]` is required in practice. Most trigger adapters emit one `text` block, but richer multimodal content is allowed. Note that `reply_channel` does not exist (`duplex = false`).

Usage:

```elixir
input = %BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger{
  id: github_delivery_id,
  source: "bullx://gateway/github/default",
  content: GitHub.Events.IssueOpened.to_content(event),
  event: %{
    name: "github.issue.opened",
    version: 1,
    data: %{repository: event.repository, issue_number: event.issue_number}
  },
  actor: %{
    id: "github:#{event.sender_login}",
    display: event.sender_login,
    bot: false
  },
  refs: GitHub.Events.IssueOpened.to_refs(event),
  channel: {:github, "default"},
  scope_id: event.repository,
  thread_id: nil
}

case BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound(input) do
  {:ok, :published} -> ack_external_source()
  {:ok, :duplicate} -> ack_external_source()
  {:error, reason}  -> retry_via_external_source(reason)
end
```

### 6.4 Event model — adapter-internal struct freedom

The Gateway protocol layer is the seven canonical semantic-type structs (§6.3); whether an adapter additionally defines a per-platform-event struct is purely an adapter engineering decision. Gateway **does not care, does not assume, does not recommend, does not forbid**.

For example, the Feishu adapter might organize internally as:

```text
BullXGateway.Adapters.Feishu.Events.MessagePosted
BullXGateway.Adapters.Feishu.Events.CardActionClicked
BullXGateway.Adapters.Feishu.Events.ReactionCreated
BullXGateway.Adapters.Feishu.Events.MessageEdited
BullXGateway.Adapters.Feishu.Events.MessageRecalled
...
```

Each adapter-internal struct typically exposes:

- `from_raw/1 :: raw_payload -> {:ok, t()} | {:error, reason}`;
- `to_canonical/1 :: t() -> BullXGateway.Inputs.*` — maps the platform event into one of Gateway's seven canonical structs;
- Or the adapter may forgo internal structs entirely and use helper functions — equally valid.

**The Gateway contract only cares which `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` canonical struct is finally submitted.** Adapter-internal code organization does not enter the Gateway contract.

**Guiding principles:**

- The canonical mapping carries only the fields Runtime / tools will use; do not relay 100+ platform fields.
- `content` is the model-facing / operator-facing projection. When a semantic type has no native body (reaction / recall / slash command / some actions), Gateway may default-render one `text` block.
- `event.data` is a structured projection for machine routing / tool calls; values stay JSON-friendly, keys may be atoms inside the adapter and Gateway canonicalizes at the boundary.
- `refs` exposes stable anchors so Runtime / skills do not parse `content` text to rediscover structure.

### 6.5 `publish_inbound/1` API and pipeline

```elixir
@spec BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound(
        BullXGateway.Inputs.Message.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageEdited.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageRecalled.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.Reaction.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.Action.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.SlashCommand.t()
        | BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger.t(),
        keyword()
      ) ::
        {:ok, :published}
        | {:ok, :duplicate}
        | {:error, {:invalid_input, term()}}
        | {:error, {:security_denied, :verify, atom(), String.t()}}
        | {:error, {:policy_denied, :gating | :moderation, atom(), String.t()}}
        | {:error, {:moderation_invalid_return, module(), term()}}
        | {:error, {:bus_publish_failed, term()}}
        | {:error, {:store_unavailable, term()}}
```

**Call flow** (the Security / Gating / Moderation hooks are defined in §6.8):

```text
External transport event
  -> adapter-private parser / verifier (HMAC / JWT / timestamp window / ...)
  -> adapter builds typed event struct (optional) + maps to canonical struct
  -> BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound(input, opts)
     1. InboundReceived.new/1 canonicalize + validate (§4.9)
     2. Security.verify_sender (§6.8) — failure returns {:error, {:security_denied, :verify, _, _}}, no mark_seen
     3. Deduper.seen?(source, id) — ETS hot path + dedupe_seen backing; hit returns {:ok, :duplicate}
     4. Construct SignalContext (§6.8)
     5. Gating.run_checks — failure returns {:error, {:policy_denied, :gating, _, _}}
     6. Moderation.apply_moderators — :reject returns {:error, {:policy_denied, :moderation, _, _}};
        :modify replaces signal (re-runs §4.9 validation); :flag accumulates into extensions.bullx_flags
     7. Jido.Signal.Bus.publish(BullXGateway.SignalBus, [signal])
        — failure returns {:error, {:bus_publish_failed, _}}; external source retries
     8. Deduper.mark_seen(source, id, ttl_ms) — writes ETS + gateway_dedupe_seen
     9. Return {:ok, :published}
  -> adapter ack the external event according to the return (webhook 2xx / websocket ack / polling commit)
```

**Adapter ack contract:**

```elixir
case BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound(input) do
  {:ok, :published} -> ack              # published to Bus AND marked seen
  {:ok, :duplicate} -> ack              # already recorded, adapter MUST ack
  {:error, _}       -> do_not_ack       # not published, external source MUST retry
end
```

**Why ack-after-publish is sufficient.** The external source's own retry (webhook redelivery, websocket reconnect replay, polling commit-on-ack) is the single recovery loop for a publish gap. Because `mark_seen` only writes on a successful `Bus.publish`, a Bus failure leaves no dedupe trace and the source's retry proceeds normally. `signal.id` is stable (derived from the external event id), so a subscriber that sees the same signal twice because of retry is idempotent on `signal.id`. There is no in-flight per-event row to reap and no background replay sweep.

**Rejection-path persistence rules.** Security / Gating / Moderation failures are reported only via `:telemetry` (§6.8) and the synchronous return value. Nothing is written to PostgreSQL for rejected inbound events.

### 6.6 `Webhook.RawBodyReader`

**Webhook is just a transport shell, not a business abstraction.** GitHub, Shopify, Stripe, DingTalk, Feishu have entirely different signature algorithms, payload structures, retry semantics, and event rendering. Gateway Core does not abstract these differences and does not define `BullXGateway.WebhookRequest` (raw body / headers / query / remote IP are adapter-internal concerns).

Each webhook source is its own adapter and **self-hosts its listener**: the listener is part of the adapter's `child_specs/2` subtree. Adapters may share library-level utilities (e.g. an HMAC verification helper), but those do not become Gateway Core protocol.

**However**, Gateway provides one strictly-scoped helper:

```elixir
BullXGateway.Webhook.RawBodyReader     # Plug body_reader implementation
# Usage: plug Plug.Parsers, body_reader: {BullXGateway.Webhook.RawBodyReader, :read_body, []}
```

It solves the mechanical problem that "Plug consumes the body by default, leaving downstream verifiers without the original bytes". It contains **no verification logic**. Adapters use it to obtain the raw body, then perform HMAC / JWT / any-algorithm verification themselves.

**`RawBodyReader` and the "Gateway Core does not depend on `Plug.Conn`" boundary.**

- **Gateway Core** (`BullXGateway` / `ControlPlane` / `Dispatcher` / `Adapter` behaviour / `Inputs.*` / signal modules / Security / Gating / Moderation behaviours) **does not depend on `Plug.Conn`** — the core runtime path contains no Plug types.
- **`BullXGateway.Webhook.RawBodyReader`** is an **optional adapter-support helper** placed under the `BullXGateway.Webhook` subnamespace; adapters `use` / `import` it inside their own webhook listeners on demand.
- **Compile-time dependency.** `plug` is declared as an **optional dependency** in `mix.exs` (`{:plug, "~> 1.14", optional: true}`). An adapter that uses `RawBodyReader` (or a host app like `BullXWeb`) declares `:plug` non-optional itself; environments without webhook adapters do not pull Plug into the compile closure.
- **Applicable scope.** Useful only for HTTP-webhook adapters (GitHub / Shopify / Stripe / Feishu webhook listeners). Long-polling / WebSocket / queue-consumer adapters do not need this helper.
- If a project does not want the Gateway app to carry any Plug optional dependency, `RawBodyReader` may be moved into `BullXWeb` or into a separate `bullx_gateway_webhook` package. This RFC keeps it under the Gateway subnamespace by default because the implementation is tiny (a few dozen lines).

**`RawBodyReader` (transport layer) vs. `Security.verify_sender` (platform layer).**

- `RawBodyReader` + adapter signature verification is a **transport-layer** check: did the external source actually send these bytes?
- `Security.verify_sender` is a **platform / business trust decision**: is this verified sender still allowed to enter?

The two coexist; neither overlaps nor replaces the other.

### 6.7 Degradation principles

Degradation is the adapter's responsibility. Gateway only insists on two hard boundaries:

1. **Gateway does not invent business fallback commands.** Runtime that wants to send a card must supply `fallback_text` (§5.2 hard contract); an adapter that does not support cards sends `fallback_text` and makes no business decisions.
2. **Degradation must be visible.** `Outcome.status = :degraded` and `warnings` records the reason (e.g. `"card_fallback_to_text"`).

The egress application of this rule is detailed in RFC 0003.

### 6.8 Policy pipeline

Gateway introduces **three pluggable pipeline hooks** — `Gating`, `Moderation`, `Security` — modelled after `jido_messaging`. **All defaults are empty.** Gateway itself ships no policy; the application wires modules into config.

**Guiding principle:** Gateway owns the carriage and the pipeline; the application owns the policy.

This RFC owns the unified pipeline definition because the inbound flow defines `Security.verify_sender`, the moderation behaviours, and the gating behaviour. The egress side reuses `Security.sanitize_outbound` (RFC 0003 references this section).

#### 6.8.1 Behaviour definitions

**`BullXGateway.Gating`:**

```elixir
defmodule BullXGateway.Gating do
  alias BullXGateway.SignalContext

  @type reason :: atom()
  @type description :: String.t()
  @type result :: :allow | {:deny, reason(), description()}

  @callback check(ctx :: SignalContext.t(), opts :: keyword()) :: result()
end
```

**`BullXGateway.Moderation`:**

```elixir
defmodule BullXGateway.Moderation do
  @type reason :: atom()
  @type description :: String.t()
  @type result ::
          :allow
          | {:reject, reason(), description()}
          | {:flag, reason(), description()}
          | {:modify, Jido.Signal.t()}

  @callback moderate(signal :: Jido.Signal.t(), opts :: keyword()) :: result()
end
```

A moderator receives the **already-rendered `%Jido.Signal{}`** (not a `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` struct). When it returns `:modify`, it must return a JSON-neutral signal that satisfies the §4.9 validation. Gateway re-runs the §4.9 validation on the modified signal; failure yields `{:error, {:moderation_invalid_return, module, detail}}`.

**`BullXGateway.Security`:**

```elixir
defmodule BullXGateway.Security do
  @type stage :: :verify | :sanitize
  @type input ::
          BullXGateway.Inputs.Message.t()
          | BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageEdited.t()
          | BullXGateway.Inputs.MessageRecalled.t()
          | BullXGateway.Inputs.Reaction.t()
          | BullXGateway.Inputs.Action.t()
          | BullXGateway.Inputs.SlashCommand.t()
          | BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger.t()

  @callback verify_sender(
              channel :: {atom(), String.t()},
              input :: input(),
              opts :: keyword()
            ) :: :ok | {:ok, map()} | {:deny, atom(), String.t()} | {:error, term()}

  @callback sanitize_outbound(
              channel :: {atom(), String.t()},
              delivery :: BullX.Delivery.t(),
              opts :: keyword()
            ) :: {:ok, BullX.Delivery.t()} | {:ok, BullX.Delivery.t(), map()} | {:error, term()}
end
```

The shape borrows from `jido_messaging` but is BullX-specific: inputs are `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` canonical structs and `BullXGateway.Delivery`, not raw bodies or `incoming_message` types — Gateway is explicit about not touching raw bodies (§6.6).

**There is no `OutboundModeration` behaviour.** Outbound policy uses the single `Security.sanitize_outbound` hook (string truncation, URL stripping, emoji limits, etc.). Heavier content policy (tone, PII strip) belongs to the Runtime generation layer — applied where the LLM context is available.

**Rate limiting and PII redaction do not get dedicated behaviours.**

- Inbound rate limiting -> write a `Gating` module that returns `{:deny, :rate_limited, _}`.
- PII redaction -> write a `Moderation` module that returns `{:modify, redacted_signal}`.

#### 6.8.2 `BullXGateway.SignalContext`

The Gating context is derived from the rendered signal; gaters do not need to re-parse it.

```elixir
defmodule BullXGateway.SignalContext do
  @type t :: %__MODULE__{
    signal_type: String.t(),              # always "com.agentbull.x.inbound.received"
    event_type: atom(),                   # :message | :message_edited | :message_recalled |
                                          # :reaction | :action | :slash_command | :trigger
    event_name: String.t(),
    event_version: integer(),
    event_data: map(),                    # adapter-owned structured projection
    channel: {atom(), String.t()},
    scope_id: String.t(),
    thread_id: String.t() | nil,
    actor: %{id: String.t(), display: String.t(), bot: boolean()},
    duplex: boolean(),
    content: [map()],
    refs: [map()],
    signal: Jido.Signal.t()               # escape hatch
  }
end
```

This corresponds to jido_messaging's `MsgContext` but does not port `was_mentioned` / `agent_mentions` / `chat_type` / `command` — those are chat-domain semantics that the Gateway carrier layer does not recognise. Application code that needs those fields reads them off `event_data` (the adapter's concrete payload).

**`event_type` is Gateway's; `event_name` is the adapter's** — together they give gaters / moderators two granularities for dispatch. `event_data` is surfaced directly on the context (rather than forcing gaters through `ctx.signal.data["event"]["data"]`) so the four-field group stays flat and symmetric.

#### 6.8.3 Pipeline ordering

**Inbound (`publish_inbound/1`):**

```text
1. typed Signal canonicalize                 -> {:error, {:invalid_input, _}} on fail
2. Security.verify_sender                    -> {:error, {:security_denied, :verify, _, _}} on deny
                                                metadata merged into signal.extensions["bullx_security"]
3. Deduper.seen?(source, id)                 -> {:ok, :duplicate} returns here
4. Construct SignalContext
5. Gating.run_checks                         -> {:error, {:policy_denied, :gating, _, _}} on deny
6. Moderation.apply_moderators               -> {:error, {:policy_denied, :moderation, _, _}} on reject
                                                :flag accumulates into extensions["bullx_flags"]
                                                :modify replaces signal (re-validates §4.9)
7. Bus.publish(SignalBus, [signal])          -> {:error, {:bus_publish_failed, _}} on failure
8. Deduper.mark_seen(source, id, ttl_ms)
9. {:ok, :published}
```

**Why Security comes before Dedupe but Gating / Moderation come after:**

- A Security failure (unauthorized sender) must not `mark_seen`. Once the sender is authorised, the next event must enter the pipeline.
- A Gating / Moderation failure means "this one is not handled". Letting Dedupe short-circuit first is more efficient (already decided once, no need to re-decide).
- `mark_seen` runs only at step 8 (after Bus.publish succeeds). On failure, no dedupe is recorded — so the external source's retry can still get through.

**Outbound (`deliver/1`)** — the unified pipeline that RFC 0003 implements:

```text
1. Delivery shape validation
2. Channel lookup
3. Capabilities pre-check (§6.2) — only op capability (:send | :edit | :stream)
4. Security.sanitize_outbound                -> {:error, {:security_denied, :sanitize, _, _}} on deny
5. OutboundDeduper.seen?(delivery.id)        -> hit republishes the cached success outcome
                                                (only terminal success is cached)
6. ScopeWorker.enqueue(channel, scope_id, delivery)   — in-memory cast
7. ScopeWorker invokes adapter.deliver / stream
8. Outcome normalised -> delivery.** publish + OutboundDeduper.mark_success on terminal success
                      -> terminal failure writes gateway_dead_letters + publishes delivery.failed

DLQ replay path (RFC 0003): skips step 3 / step 5; rebuilds the Delivery from the dead-letter row and re-enters at step 6.
```

The egress steps run inside RFC 0003's `Dispatcher` / `ScopeWorker`. The ScopeWorker queue is in-memory; the only Store interaction on the outbound path is the DLQ write on terminal failure.

#### 6.8.4 Configuration

```elixir
config :bullx, :gateway,
  gating: [
    gaters: [MyApp.TenantAllowlist, MyApp.RateLimit],
    gating_opts: [tenant_file: "priv/tenants.json"],
    gating_timeout_ms: 50
  ],
  moderation: [
    moderators: [MyApp.PiiRedact, MyApp.BotEchoFilter],
    moderation_opts: [],
    moderation_timeout_ms: 100
  ],
  security: [
    adapter: MyApp.SecurityAdapter,
    adapter_opts: [],
    verify_timeout_ms: 50,
    sanitize_timeout_ms: 50
  ],
  policy_timeout_fallback: :deny,       # :deny | :allow_with_flag
  policy_error_fallback: :deny
```

Gateway reads these settings through `BullX.Config.Gateway`, not direct `Application.get_env/2` calls. Resolution priority for a Gateway setting is: code default -> application config -> OS env -> PostgreSQL override; per-call override (`publish_inbound(input, gating: [...])`) remains highest for that one call.

**Ordering within a stage:** list order is execution order; the first `:deny` short-circuits; moderator `:modify` cascades; `:flag` accumulates; `:reject` short-circuits.

#### 6.8.5 Error handling

Each hook runs under `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink` + `Task.yield` (falling back to `Task.shutdown(:brutal_kill)` on timeout), against the `BullXGateway.PolicyTaskSupervisor` child of `BullXGateway.CoreSupervisor`. `async_nolink` is chosen so hook work is isolated from the caller's process; `BullXGateway.PolicyRunner` normalizes raised hook errors before the task exits so the caller can apply `policy_error_fallback` without polluting logs with expected task-crash reports. Defaults: a `raise` / timeout / invalid shape resolves through `policy_error_fallback` / `policy_timeout_fallback` (both default `:deny`).

A `:modify` returning an invalid shape produces `{:error, {:moderation_invalid_return, _, _}}`; the signal does not enter the Bus.

#### 6.8.6 Telemetry

Two spans plus one terminal outbound event (seven events total) are emitted:

```text
[:bullx, :gateway, :publish_inbound, :start]
[:bullx, :gateway, :publish_inbound, :stop]
  metadata.policy_outcome ::
    :published | :duplicate | :denied_security | :denied_gating | :rejected_moderation
[:bullx, :gateway, :publish_inbound, :exception]
[:bullx, :gateway, :deliver, :start]
[:bullx, :gateway, :deliver, :stop]
  metadata.outcome :: :accepted | :duplicate | :unsupported | :invalid_delivery | :security_denied
[:bullx, :gateway, :deliver, :exception]
[:bullx, :gateway, :delivery, :finished]
  measurements.attempts :: non_neg_integer
  metadata.outcome :: :sent | :degraded | :failed
  metadata.error_kind :: String.t() | nil
```

The `:deliver` span wraps the synchronous enqueue (validate / capability / dedupe / cast ScopeWorker) and always returns quickly; its `outcome` is the enqueue verdict, not the async execution result. The async terminal result — success, degradation, or dead-letter — surfaces exactly once per delivery on `:delivery, :finished`. Per-stage policy decision events are redundant with `publish_inbound:stop.policy_outcome`; per-attempt retry events are redundant with the `attempts` distribution on `:delivery, :finished`; store transaction timing surfaces via the top-level span when the DB is slow. The span events are emitted via `:telemetry.span/3`; `:delivery, :finished` uses `:telemetry.execute/3` from `ScopeWorker`.

## 7. Runtime structure

### 7.1 Lifecycle and startup ordering

Gateway is Runtime's prerequisite infrastructure: `BullXGateway.CoreSupervisor` starts before `BullX.Runtime.Supervisor`. **There is no `IngressControl` global switch** — startup ordering is the ingress gate:

```text
BullX.Repo                                 # PostgreSQL connection; before Gateway
BullX.Config                               # see RFC 0001
BullXGateway.CoreSupervisor               # Bus + ControlPlane + Dispatcher + DLQ + Deduper
BullX.Skills.Supervisor
BullXBrain.Supervisor
BullX.Runtime.Supervisor                   # subscribes to SignalBus
BullXGateway.AdapterSupervisor            # the application attaches this child after Runtime is ready
```

**Startup order is the only ingress gate**: Runtime subscribes to the Bus before `AdapterSupervisor` is attached, so no inbound signal is published into an empty Bus. If a `Bus.publish` ever fails, `publish_inbound/1` returns an error and the adapter declines to ack — the external source retries and drives the recovery loop.

`BullXWeb.Endpoint` is the control-plane application's own startup item, not part of the Gateway contract.

### 7.2 Core supervision tree

```text
BullXGateway.CoreSupervisor
├── BullXGateway.ControlPlane            # GenServer; serializes Store reads/writes
├── BullXGateway.SignalBus               # Jido.Signal.Bus instance
├── BullXGateway.AdapterRegistry
├── BullXGateway.ScopeRegistry           # Registry (used by ScopeWorker names)               -- (RFC 0003)
├── BullXGateway.Dispatcher              # DynamicSupervisor of ScopeWorker                    -- (RFC 0003)
├── BullXGateway.Deduper                 # ETS hot cache + Store backing                       -- this RFC
├── BullXGateway.OutboundDeduper         # ETS 5-min TTL, outbound delivery.id dedupe          -- (RFC 0003)
├── BullXGateway.DLQ.ReplaySupervisor    # Registry + N ReplayWorker                           -- (RFC 0003)
├── BullXGateway.Retention               # hourly retention sweep                              -- this RFC migrates the inbound schedule
└── BullXGateway.Telemetry

BullXGateway.AdapterSupervisor           # attached by the application
├── Registry                              # channel -> per-channel supervisor pid
└── DynamicSupervisor
    └── per-channel adapter supervisors   # each wraps adapter.child_specs/2
```

Children that this RFC implements: `ControlPlane`, `SignalBus`, `AdapterRegistry`, `Deduper`, `Retention`, `Telemetry`, and `AdapterSupervisor`. `AdapterSupervisor` owns the per-channel lifecycle but does not implement any concrete adapter.

Children supervised by `CoreSupervisor` but **implemented by RFC 0003**: `Dispatcher`, `ScopeRegistry`, `OutboundDeduper`, `DLQ.ReplaySupervisor`. They appear in the tree shape so the supervisor child list is complete and stable across both RFCs; their internal modules and behaviour are defined in RFC 0003.

(There is no `IngressControl`, no `AdapterHealth`.)

### 7.3 `Jido.Signal.Bus` usage

Plain publish / subscribe; no persistent subscriptions (durability is the ControlPlane's job, not Bus checkpoints):

```elixir
Jido.Signal.Bus.publish(BullXGateway.SignalBus, [signal])

Jido.Signal.Bus.subscribe(
  BullXGateway.SignalBus,
  "com.agentbull.x.inbound.**",
  dispatch: {:pid, target: runtime_dispatcher}
)

Jido.Signal.Bus.subscribe(
  BullXGateway.SignalBus,
  "com.agentbull.x.delivery.**",
  dispatch: {:pid, target: runtime_delivery_watcher}
)
```

### 7.4 ControlPlane, Store, and tables

`BullXGateway.ControlPlane` is the serialized entry point for all durable writes (a GenServer). The persistence layer is abstracted by the `Store` behaviour:

```elixir
defmodule BullXGateway.ControlPlane.Store do
  # inbound dedupe (this RFC implements)
  @callback put_dedupe_seen(map) :: :ok | {:error, term}
  @callback fetch_dedupe_seen(key :: String.t()) :: {:ok, map} | :error
  @callback list_active_dedupe_seen() :: {:ok, [map]}
  @callback delete_expired_dedupe_seen() :: {:ok, non_neg_integer}

  # dead letters (RFC 0003 implements)
  @callback put_dead_letter(map) :: :ok | {:error, term}
  @callback fetch_dead_letter(dispatch_id :: String.t()) :: {:ok, map} | :error
  @callback list_dead_letters(filters :: keyword) :: {:ok, [map]}
  @callback increment_dead_letter_replay_count(dispatch_id :: String.t()) :: :ok | {:error, term}
  @callback delete_old_dead_letters(before :: DateTime.t()) :: {:ok, non_neg_integer}

  @callback transaction((module() -> result)) :: {:ok, result} | {:error, term}
end
```

The full behaviour signature lives in this RFC because the ControlPlane GenServer that hosts it is started by `CoreSupervisor` here. RFC 0003 implements the dead-letter callbacks (and the matching table).

**Sole implementation: `BullXGateway.ControlPlane.Store.Postgres`** (built on `BullX.Repo`). dev / test use the same PostgreSQL backend through the Ecto sandbox; no ETS backend is maintained, so the dev environment cannot drift from production. The behaviour abstraction exists for future pluggability and Mox-style unit tests, not for environment differentiation.

#### 7.4.1 Persistence strategy

The Gateway has exactly two tables. Both are UNLOGGED.

| Table | PostgreSQL kind | Migrated by | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gateway_dedupe_seen` | **UNLOGGED** | this RFC | Hot-cache backing; ETS rebuilds it after crash; external sources retry un-acked inbound events. |
| `gateway_dead_letters` | **UNLOGGED** | RFC 0003 | Ops-visible failure evidence; loss on unclean server crash is acceptable — Runtime + Oban re-dispatches, and a fresh terminal failure writes a new row. |

**Rationale.** The Gateway reliability boundary is "carrier-layer correctness" — *an inbound event accepted by Gateway is published to the Bus, and the policy pipeline runs before publish* — not "persist every intermediate state". Runtime + Oban holds the business-layer retry semantics; adapters hold the external-source ack semantics. In-flight envelopes (inbound pre-publish, outbound dispatches, per-attempt rows) are intentionally **not** persisted at all. UNLOGGED tables provide transactional + unique-index semantics without writing to the WAL: on an unclean server crash they are truncated, Runtime re-issues outstanding work, the external source retries un-acked inbound events.

Ecto migration style: UNLOGGED tables use `execute("CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE ...")` + `execute("DROP TABLE ...")`; if an existing table needs to switch, use `execute("ALTER TABLE ... SET UNLOGGED")`.

#### 7.4.2 `gateway_dedupe_seen` (this RFC migrates)

**`gateway_dedupe_seen`** (UNLOGGED):

| Column | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `dedupe_key` | `text` PK |
| `source` | `text` |
| `external_id` | `text` |
| `expires_at` | `timestamptz` |
| `seen_at` | `timestamptz` |

Indexes:
- PRIMARY KEY `(dedupe_key)`
- `(expires_at)`

`dedupe_key` is `sha256("#{source}|#{external_id}")`.

#### 7.4.3 Outbound table (RFC 0003 migrates; shape shown for completeness)

The single outbound table (`gateway_dead_letters`, UNLOGGED) is migrated by RFC 0003. Its full schema and index definitions live in that document. This RFC does not migrate it.

### 7.5 Inbound `Deduper`

**`BullXGateway.Deduper`** (inbound) — ETS hot cache + `gateway_dedupe_seen` durable backing:

1. Gateway boot -> `Deduper.init/1` calls `Store.list_active_dedupe_seen()` to rehydrate ETS.
2. `publish_inbound/1` step 3 queries ETS; on ETS miss it falls through to `Store.fetch_dedupe_seen/1`.
3. Step 8 (after `Bus.publish` succeeds) writes the Store first, then the ETS hot cache.
4. Sweep every minute: ETS local cleanup + `Store.delete_expired_dedupe_seen()`.
5. **TTL is per-adapter** (configured via `AdapterRegistry`'s `:dedupe_ttl_ms`): Feishu 5 minutes, GitHub 72 hours, others per their RFCs; default 24 hours.

The outbound `OutboundDeduper` is a sibling process supervised under `CoreSupervisor` but defined and implemented in RFC 0003.

### 7.6 Retention (inbound parts)

`BullXGateway.Retention` (hourly schedule, inbound responsibilities only — RFC 0003 owns the outbound rules):

- Delete `gateway_dedupe_seen WHERE expires_at < now`.

The remaining retention rules (`gateway_dead_letters` 90-day retention) belong to RFC 0003.

## 8. Inbound pipelines

### 8.1 Feishu inbound: chat message -> Runtime

```text
Feishu push / WebSocket
  -> Feishu adapter listener (decryption / signature verification / self-echo filter)
  -> Feishu.Events.MessagePosted.from_raw(payload)
  -> mapped to %BullXGateway.Inputs.Message{event.type implied by struct}
     - actor.id = "feishu:#{open_id}"
  -> BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound(input)
     - Security.verify_sender (the application can plug in a tenant allowlist)
     - Deduper (source, id) check
     - Gating / Moderation (default empty)
     - Bus.publish
     - Deduper.mark_seen (writes ETS + gateway_dedupe_seen)
  -> Runtime dispatcher subscribes to "com.agentbull.x.inbound.**"
     - Model / operator surfaces read signal.data["content"]
     - Machine routing reads signal.data["event"]["type"] + signal.data["event"]["name"]
```

### 8.2 GitHub webhook inbound -> Runtime / skill

```text
GitHub webhook HTTP POST
  -> GitHub adapter listener (uses BullXGateway.Webhook.RawBodyReader to obtain raw body
     + verifies X-Hub-Signature-256)
  -> select Events module by event header + payload:
       "issues" + action="opened" -> GitHub.Events.IssueOpened
       "pull_request" + action=*  -> GitHub.Events.PullRequestOpened / Merged / ...
  -> Events.from_raw(payload) -> typed event struct
  -> mapped to %BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger{}
  -> BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound(input)
     -> {:ok, :published} | {:ok, :duplicate} -> respond 2xx
     -> {:error, _} -> respond 5xx so GitHub retries

Runtime / DevOps skill subscribes:
  case {signal.data["event"]["type"], signal.data["event"]["name"]} do
    {"trigger", "github.issue.opened"}        -> route_to_devops_agent(signal)
    {"trigger", "stripe.payment.succeeded"}   -> route_to_billing(signal)
    _ -> :skip
  end

LLM / operator surfaces still read signal.data["content"];
the skill takes signal.data["refs"] as tool arguments (calling the GitHub tool to comment on the issue).
```

Note: The GitHub adapter does not export `deliver/2` / `stream/3` (`capabilities/0` returns `[]` or only non-outbound capabilities). When Runtime wants to comment on a GitHub issue, it uses the GitHub tool / action that calls the GitHub REST API directly; **it does not go through Gateway `deliver/1`**. This is also why `duplex = false` and there is no `reply_channel`.

The matching outbound and stream pipelines (Runtime -> Gateway -> adapter, and the streaming card flow) are documented in RFC 0003.

## 9. Reliability (inbound parts)

The reliability story for the carrier layer:

1. **Adapter listeners are OTP-supervised.** Crashes auto-restart; a single adapter failure does not bring down the rest of Gateway.
2. **Startup order is the ingress gate.** Until Runtime is ready, `AdapterSupervisor` is not started and adapters do not consume.
3. **Ack-after-publish inbound.** `publish_inbound/1` returns success only after `Bus.publish` has succeeded AND `mark_seen` has recorded the dedupe. A Bus failure returns `{:error, {:bus_publish_failed, _}}` so the adapter declines to ack and the external source retries.
4. (RFC 0003) ScopeWorker in-memory queue per `{channel, scope_id}`.
5. (RFC 0003) DLQ + manual replay.
6. **Short-lived dedupe.** `(source, id)` inbound dedupe (ETS hot cache + `gateway_dedupe_seen` UNLOGGED backing). The outbound `delivery.id` dedupe is an RFC 0003 concern.
7. **Telemetry.** Publish-failed / adapter-crashed / pipeline-decision / retention-sweep events are emitted; the inbound-specific events listed in §6.8.6 are owned here.
8. **UNLOGGED crash semantics (inbound subset).** The one UNLOGGED table this RFC migrates (`gateway_dedupe_seen`) is truncated on unclean server crash. This is acceptable: the external source retries un-acked events, Runtime re-issues outstanding outbound work via Oban.
9. **Envelope-level framing.** Gateway does **not** provide `exactly-once`; that is a Runtime + Oban + business-persistence collaboration. Gateway provides **at-least-once with idempotent dedupe** on the inbound side and **envelope-level durable failure capture** (the DLQ) on the outbound side.

The README's references to "high availability / exactly-once" are about agent workflow runtime guarantees, not Gateway-layer guarantees. The Gateway-layer guarantee is carrier-level correctness: the pipeline runs before publish, dedupe holds across retries, and terminal outbound failures become durable DLQ rows.

## 10. Non-goals

The cross-cutting non-goals (also enumerated in §2.2 for ergonomics; collected here as a standalone section):

**Business model / lifecycle:**

- Session / turn / conversation lifecycle.
- Memory / brain / knowledge graph.
- Command alias, approval, budget, HITL, subagent, cron, agent orchestration.
- "Interrupt agent on new message" concurrency control (Runtime).
- Think-block / reasoning content filtering (Runtime).

**Business modelling structs:**

- `%Room{}` / `%Participant{}` / `%Thread{}` / `%RoomBinding{}` / `%RoutingPolicy{}` are not introduced.
- No Gateway-level multi-adapter fan-out (Runtime calls `deliver/1` N times — see RFC 0003).
- No thread lifecycle, participant registry, presence, typing.
- The `scope_kind` enum was rejected (§4.8).
- `ModalClose` / `AssistantThreadStarted` (Slack-specific) are not modelled (folded into `Action` or ignored).

**Protocol-level:**

- Generic `WebhookAdapter` / unified `WebhookRequest` / raw_body / query / remote_ip abstraction (Gateway only ships `Webhook.RawBodyReader`, §6.6).
- `event` internal schema validation beyond the carrier contract (the adapter's RFC + tests + fixtures own that).
- `failure_class` enum / retry taxonomy as a protocol contract (`error.kind` + `details.retry_after_ms` is a convention; Runtime decides retry policy — see RFC 0003).
- Bus persistent subscription / ack checkpoint (durability is the ControlPlane's job).

**Policy and reliability boundaries:**

- Audit-grade rejection persistence (rejections go to telemetry only).
- Default Gating / Moderation / Security implementations (application-supplied).
- Outbound `Moderation` behaviour (outbound policy uses the single `Security.sanitize_outbound` hook).
- Approval state machine / HITL pause-resume (Runtime).

**Acceptable losses (carrier layer):**

- Mid-stream durability (only `stream_close` outcome durable; RFC 0003).
- Exactly-once business semantics (Runtime + Oban).
- UNLOGGED tables truncated on unclean server crash (Runtime / adapter / external source re-issue).

**Distribution and media:**

- Cross-node routing / distributed bus / global consistency (single-node constraint, §3.1).
- Media long-term storage / unified media cache (per-adapter).
- Album / multi-image re-batching (adapter-internal stateful normalization).
- Text metrics / chunking algorithms / media magic-bytes verification (adapter-internal).
- Cross-adapter bot-echo defense (no jido evidence, no real-world need).

**User identity:**

- Gateway's `actor` carries only `{id, display, bot}`. Mapping `actor.id` to a BullX-user-system identity is Runtime's responsibility.
- No onboarding / registration flow (synthetic actor fallback or rejection is Runtime's call).

**Outbound-specific non-goals** (enumerated in RFC 0003): no `notify_pid` channel, no Gateway-level multi-adapter fan-out for one Delivery, no `failure_class` retry taxonomy as a protocol contract.

## 11. Acceptance criteria (inbound side)

A coding agent has completed this RFC when all of the following hold. The numbering restarts at 1 for clarity within this RFC; RFC 0003 carries its own numbering for the egress side.

### 11.1 Content + event contract

1. Any `com.agentbull.x.inbound.received` signal's `data` contains a non-empty `content` list, an `event.{type, name, version, data}` map, a `duplex` boolean, an `actor.{id, display, bot}` triple, and a `refs` list (possibly empty); when `duplex = true`, `reply_channel.{adapter, channel_id, scope_id, thread_id?}` is also present.
2. `data.event.type` is one of the seven enum values (`message` / `message_edited` / `message_recalled` / `reaction` / `action` / `slash_command` / `trigger`).
3. `data.duplex` is derived from `event.type`: six chat types `true`, `trigger` `false`.
4. `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` structs may use atom-key maps / atom kinds; the final `%Jido.Signal{}`'s `data` and `extensions` must be string-key JSON-neutral maps.
5. A `%BullXGateway.Inputs.Trigger{event: %{name: "github.issue.opened", version: 1, data: %{issue_number: 101}}}` becomes `%{"event" => %{"type" => "trigger", "name" => "github.issue.opened", "version" => 1, "data" => %{"issue_number" => 101}}}` in the published signal's `data`.
6. A source with no natural actor still supplies a synthetic actor (e.g. `%{"id" => "system:market-feed", "display" => "Market Feed", "bot" => true}`).
7. `InboundReceived.new/1` fails when:
   - `content` is missing, empty, not a list, or a block is not `%{"kind" => _, "body" => map}`;
   - `content.kind` is not in the six stable kinds;
   - non-`:text` `content.body["fallback_text"]` is missing or empty;
   - `event.type` is not in the seven values;
   - `duplex` is not boolean, or inconsistent with `event.type`;
   - `event.name` is missing or not a string; `event.version` is not an integer; `event.data` is not a map;
   - `actor.id` is empty; `actor.display` is empty;
   - `duplex = true` but `reply_channel` is missing or incomplete;
   - any type-specific required field is missing (e.g. `Reaction.target_external_message_id` / `emoji` / `action`).
8. `InboundReceived.new/1` does **not** fail when:
   - `event.name = "totally.unknown.event"`;
   - `event.data = %{}`;
   - `content.body` carries fields beyond the §5.2 minimum;
   - `refs = []`.

### 11.2 Bus routing

9. Subscribing to `"com.agentbull.x.inbound.**"` receives every inbound signal (regardless of `event.type`).
10. Subscribing to `"com.agentbull.x.delivery.**"` receives `delivery.succeeded` / `delivery.failed` (RFC 0003); inbound is not seen.
11. Gateway Core code contains no branch on a specific `event.name` value; Runtime dispatches by `data.event.type` + `data.event.name`.

### 11.3 Carrier / event layering

12. The same `inbound.received` carrier transports any `event.name` (`github.issue.opened`, `stripe.payment.succeeded`, `feishu.card.action_clicked`, ...); Gateway publishes and routes correctly.
13. Runtime dispatches based on `data.event.type` (coarse) + `data.event.name` (fine) and on `data.refs` for tool argument filling; Runtime does not have to reverse-engineer structured fields out of `content`.
14. Gateway provides a dedicated `data["content"]` slot for carrier-level text / media / card; consumers do not have to parse `event.data` to read canonical content.

### 11.4 Ingress + Dedupe

15. `BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound/1` returns are distinguishable: `{:ok, :published}`, `{:ok, :duplicate}`, `{:error, reason}`.
16. The same GitHub delivery id arriving twice -> identical `(source, id)` -> within TTL, the second call returns `{:ok, :duplicate}`; the adapter ack both `:published` and `:duplicate`.
17. The Deduper may only `mark_seen` after `Bus.publish/2` succeeds; failure leaves no dedupe record.
18. After clearing the Deduper ETS and restarting, the durable `gateway_dedupe_seen` row still hits, so the second time the same id arrives -> `{:ok, :duplicate}`.
19. A `Bus.publish` failure inside `publish_inbound/1` returns `{:error, {:bus_publish_failed, _}}`; nothing is written to the Deduper; the external source retries and a subsequent successful publish marks seen normally.
20. **Per-adapter dedupe TTL.** TTL is read from each adapter's `AdapterRegistry` config (`:dedupe_ttl_ms`) and bounds the `(source, id)` window independently per adapter. With `dedupe_ttl_ms: 300_000` (5 minutes — Feishu default), the same `(source, id)` arriving 400 seconds later returns `{:ok, :published}`. With `dedupe_ttl_ms: 259_200_000` (72 hours — GitHub default), the same `(source, id)` arriving 24 hours later still returns `{:ok, :duplicate}`.

### 11.9 Policy pipeline

21. A gater returning `:allow` -> Bus receives the original signal.
22. A gater returning `:deny` -> `publish_inbound/1` returns `{:error, {:policy_denied, :gating, _, _}}`; Bus does not see the signal; Deduper is not marked.
23. A gater raising under `:deny` fallback -> same as (22). Under `:allow_with_flag` fallback -> `{:ok, :published}` with `extensions["bullx_flags"]` containing an `:error_fallback` flag.
24. A gater timeout is handled per `policy_timeout_fallback`.
25. A moderator returning `:reject` -> pipeline halts; Bus does not receive the signal.
26. A moderator returning `:flag` -> Bus receives the signal with the flag (`extensions["bullx_flags"]` accumulates).
27. A moderator returning `:modify` -> Bus receives the modified signal with `extensions["bullx_moderation_modified"] = true`.
28. A moderator `:modify` returning an invalid shape -> `{:error, {:moderation_invalid_return, _, _}}`.
29. `Security.verify_sender` returning `{:deny, _, _}` -> `{:error, {:security_denied, :verify, _, _}}`; Deduper is not marked (so the next event from a now-authorised sender can enter).
30. `Security.sanitize_outbound` (RFC 0003) stripping URLs -> the adapter receives the sanitized delivery, and `delivery.succeeded` reflects the sanitized content.
31. Pipeline ordering: the `publish_inbound:stop` event for a Security-denied input has `policy_outcome: :denied_security`.
32. Dedupe fidelity: a Security-denied event re-arriving with the same id is still security-denied (not a duplicate); after a successful publish, the same id is `:duplicate`.
33. Zero defaults: with no `:bullx, :gateway` config, every Input passes through unchanged (no flag, no modify).
34. Telemetry events: the seven events listed in §6.8.6 fire as specified — `publish_inbound` and `deliver` spans (start/stop/exception) plus one `[:bullx, :gateway, :delivery, :finished]` per terminal delivery with `metadata.outcome ∈ {:sent, :degraded, :failed}` and `measurements.attempts`.

### 11.10 Boundary isolation

35. Gateway Core code does not depend on `Plug.Conn`, does not define raw_body / query / remote_ip (`Webhook.RawBodyReader` is an optional helper, not part of the Adapter behaviour); GitHub / Shopify / Feishu webhook signature verification logic lives entirely inside the respective adapters.
36. Webhook listeners are self-hosted by their adapters; concrete webhook implementation details belong to the adapter's RFC, not to the Gateway Core RFC.
37. Gateway Core may use `BullX.Repo.*` (this RFC supersedes the original "no PostgreSQL" constraint) and may run PostgreSQL migrations; but **no `Oban.insert/1`** — Gateway does not schedule business-level jobs. (DLQ replay uses `BullXGateway.DLQ.ReplayWorker` partitioned workers, defined in RFC 0003, not Oban.)
38. Any inbound signal's `extensions` contains non-empty `bullx_channel_adapter` / `bullx_channel_id`; `scope_id` / `thread_id` live in `data` and are not duplicated into `extensions`.
39. **`subject` is human-readable only and not part of any routing path.** A signal whose `subject` has been deliberately scrambled (e.g. wrong adapter prefix, missing scope segment, garbled separator) must still be routed correctly by Runtime / subscribers consuming `extensions["bullx_channel_adapter"]`, `data["event"]["type"]`, `data["event"]["name"]`, and `data["refs"]`. No Gateway code path or documented consumer pattern parses `subject` for routing decisions.

(Outbound boundary criteria belong to RFC 0003.)

## Appendix A: `jido_signal` fact-check summary

Verified against the local source at `~/Projects/jido/jido_signal/lib`:

1. **`Jido.Signal.Bus.subscribe/3` routes by path pattern** — `jido_signal/lib/jido_signal/bus.ex`; pattern semantics come from `Jido.Signal.Router`.
2. **`Jido.Signal.new/1` may explicitly override `id`** — when `id` is omitted, `Jido.Signal.ID.generate!()` (UUID7) is invoked.
3. **`time` is an ISO8601 string** — `new/1` defaults to `DateTime.utc_now() |> DateTime.to_iso8601()`.
4. **`specversion` must be exactly `"1.0.2"`** — see `jido_signal/lib/jido_signal.ex:679-680`'s `parse_specversion/1`; other values (including `"1.0"`) return an error.
5. **`extensions` is a free-form map; only the `"dispatch"` / `"correlation"` namespaces are reserved** — BullX standardises on `bullx_*` prefixes.
6. **`Bus.publish/2` performs only structural validation; it does not mutate signals** — `jido_signal/lib/jido_signal/bus.ex:1149-1159`'s `validate_signals/1`.

(Earlier draft material on Bus persistent subscription ack-checkpoint details is no longer relevant; this RFC does not use persistent subscriptions, and durability is the ControlPlane's responsibility.)

## Appendix B: Dependency boundary

Gateway Core dependencies (introduced by this RFC; RFC 0003 inherits and adds nothing new):

- `:jido_signal` — event envelope + Bus.
- `:ecto_sql` + `:postgrex` — accessed through `BullX.Repo` for durable intake and (in RFC 0003) the DLQ.
- `:plug` — **optional dependency** (`{:plug, "~> 1.14", optional: true}`), required only by adapters that use `BullXGateway.Webhook.RawBodyReader` (§6.6). Adapters that do not need RawBodyReader omit it; environments without webhook adapters do not pull Plug into the compile closure.

Other dependencies (`Req`, WebSocket clients, specific source SDKs) are introduced by the corresponding adapter RFCs.

`BullX.Repo` itself is provided by the application (the existing BullX PostgreSQL connection); this RFC adds one new table migration (`gateway_dedupe_seen`, UNLOGGED). RFC 0003 adds one more (`gateway_dead_letters`, UNLOGGED). These are the only two Gateway tables.

## Appendix C: Consistency with `0000_Architecture.md`

`rfcs/plans/0000_Architecture.md`'s subsystem startup order is preliminary scaffolding.

This RFC clarifies:

- **Gateway Core is Runtime's prerequisite infrastructure** (`CoreSupervisor` starts before `Runtime.Supervisor`).
- **`Gateway.AdapterSupervisor` is attached by the application after Runtime is ready** (replacing the original `IngressControl` global switch with a flatter, more explicit mechanism).
- **Gateway requires `BullX.Repo`** (PostgreSQL connection) to be available before `CoreSupervisor`.
- The startup order is therefore adjusted from the draft "Runtime before Gateway" to "Repo -> Gateway.CoreSupervisor -> Runtime.Supervisor -> AdapterSupervisor".

The concrete code-level placement is performed in the implementation RFCs (this RFC and RFC 0003).

## Appendix D: BullX vs. jido ecosystem mapping

This RFC is the result of aligning BullX Gateway with the jido official trio (`jido_chat` + `jido_messaging` + `jido_integration`). The boundary mapping (full table; rows mentioning outbound concerns are flagged so the reader can navigate to RFC 0003):

| jido | BullX Gateway |
| --- | --- |
| `jido_chat` canonical event payload structs (`Incoming` / `ReactionEvent` / `ActionEvent` / `SlashCommandEvent`) | `BullXGateway.Inputs.*` — seven canonical semantic-type structs (§4.3 / §6.3); the library defines the standard event shape and adapters do the mapping |
| `jido_chat.Adapter.capabilities/0` | `BullXGateway.Adapter.capabilities/0` (§6.2) — declares supported ops |
| `jido_chat.Adapter.stream/3` | `BullXGateway.Adapter.stream/3` (§6.2; full egress contract in RFC 0003) — Enumerable stream; the adapter manages throttle / sequence / finalize |
| `jido_messaging.Gating / Moderation / Security` behaviours | `BullXGateway.Gating / Moderation / Security` (§6.8) — pluggable pipeline hooks; defaults empty |
| `jido_messaging.Deduper` + DLQ + replay | `BullXGateway.Deduper` (§7.5, this RFC) + `OutboundDeduper` + `gateway_dead_letters` + `ReplayWorker` (RFC 0003) — ETS hot cache + PostgreSQL durable backing |
| `jido_messaging.DeliveryPolicy.backoff` | `BullXGateway.RetryPolicy` + `Outcome.error.details["retry_after_ms"]` (RFC 0003) |
| `jido_integration.Ingress.admit_webhook` durable intake | `BullX.Gateway.publish_inbound/1` + ack-after-publish dedupe (§6.5, this RFC) |
| `jido_integration.DispatchRuntime` (dispatch queue + retry + dead-letter) | `BullXGateway.Dispatcher` + in-memory `ScopeWorker` + `gateway_dead_letters` (RFC 0003) |
| `jido_integration.ControlPlane` (durable run / attempt storage) | `BullXGateway.ControlPlane` + Store behaviour (§7.4, dedupe callbacks here and dead-letter callbacks in RFC 0003) — single PostgreSQL implementation; dev/test via Ecto sandbox |
| `jido_integration.WebhookRouter.verification` | **Not adopted** — each adapter does its own verification; Gateway only ships `Webhook.RawBodyReader` (§6.6) |
| `jido_integration.ConsumerProjection` generated Sensor / Plugin | **Not adopted** — BullX Runtime calls `Bus.subscribe` directly; no codegen |
| `jido_messaging.Room / Participant / Thread / RoomBinding / RoutingPolicy` | **Not adopted** — flat `{channel, scope_id, thread_id, actor, refs}` covers the surveyed IM / webhook scenarios (Feishu streaming / recall / edit / reaction / card action / group reply / multi-room / multi-channel) |
| `jido_chat.ModalSubmitEvent / ModalCloseEvent` | **Not adopted** — Slack-specific; modal submit is folded into `Action` (§4.3) |

The spirit is consistent: **the carriage layer (including reliability) is small and stable, the domain layer is distributed and extensible, the policy layer is pluggable**. Differences in BullX Gateway:

1. **More than `jido_chat`:** ack-after-publish inbound dedupe; DLQ + replay; pipeline hooks.
2. **Less than `jido_messaging`:** no Room / Participant / Thread business model (lives in Runtime); no persistent Session.
3. **Less than `jido_integration`:** no connector manifest, no generated Sensor, no cross-tenant auth lifecycle.
4. **Unique:** the Gateway-owned `event.type` semantic axis (`message` / `message_edited` / `message_recalled` / `reaction` / `action` / `slash_command` / `trigger`) + the `duplex` axis — these are BullX's specialisations for IM / webhook hybrid scenarios.
