> :warning: **BullX is currently in early development. Expect significant changes and updates.**

**A general-purpose AgentOS — with unique advantages in high-stakes domains like finance.**

BullX is a highly available, self-evolving, and self-healing AI Agent Operating System built on Elixir/OTP and PostgreSQL for long-running, production-grade agent workloads. Its reliability guarantees, durable state, auditable memory, and human-in-the-loop controls matter most in environments where downtime, cost overruns, lost context, or silent failures carry real consequences.

## Highlights

### Production-Grade Runtime

Further context: [Why OTP is a better runtime for multi-agent orchestration](https://ding.ee/en-US/why-otp-is-a-better-runtime-for-multi-agent-orchestration/) explains why Elixir/OTP is central to BullX's design.

- **Highly Available** — Built on Elixir and Erlang/OTP, a carrier-grade, fault-tolerant language and runtime. Supervision trees handle process scheduling, state ownership, failure isolation, and restart recovery as first-class primitives, so BullX recovers from failures automatically and keeps running through partial outages.
- **Durable State on PostgreSQL** — PostgreSQL is the system of record for sessions, memory, and knowledge, giving BullX transactional writes, replication, and point-in-time recovery out of the box — no bespoke on-disk formats to evolve or migrate.
- **Self-Healing** — Individual agent processes can crash without affecting the rest of the system; supervisors restart them in a known-good state, isolating faults at the process boundary.
- **Built for Long-Running Workflows** — BullX is engineered for agent tasks that run for days or weeks, not seconds — deep research, overnight backtests, continuous monitoring. Scheduled and cron-style jobs execute with **exactly-once semantics** across restarts, failovers, and crashes, so nothing silently drops and nothing silently duplicates.

### Evolving Memory & World Model

- **Self-Evolving Memory** — Memory is a reasoning loop, not a log. BullX extracts structured traces from every interaction at distinct inference levels — direct observations, deductions, inductions, contradictions — while a background consolidation process merges redundancy, detects conflicts between old and new beliefs, and promotes low-level observations into higher-level patterns. Superseded memories are soft-deleted rather than erased, so every conclusion keeps its provenance chain and the system's evolving understanding is reconstructible over time.
- **Ontology-Driven Knowledge Graph** — A typed ontology of entities, relations, and properties forms BullX's world model. Every entity is both a graph node traversable by relation AND a container for its own accumulated reasoning, so planning and recall operate on a shared domain schema rather than loose text snippets. Typed links act as a guardrail against hallucinated relationships at extraction time.
- **Multi-Perspective Memory** — A brain-like memory system has to mirror how minds actually work: the same entity doesn't exist as one shared "objective" record — it lives as a different internal representation in each observer's mind, shaped by that observer's own interaction history. BullX mirrors this at the data layer. Memory is organized by (observer, observed) pairs — each with its own independently-evolving reasoning chain — so distinct and potentially contradictory views of the same entity can coexist, stay self-consistent, and be queried by viewpoint rather than collapsed into a single fused record.

### Perception & Intent

- **Dual-Channel Perception** — Two input channels feed the same reasoning layer: conversations with users or other agents, and external events delivered as **CloudEvents-compliant** triggers (policy changes, market moves, supply-chain disruptions, earnings releases, webhook callbacks). BullX reacts to the world whether or not someone brings it up — essential for domains where signals don't wait for a prompt.
- **Business-Intent Understanding** — A dedicated layer maps incoming requests onto concepts and goals in the business ontology, so the agent plans against what the user is trying to achieve, not the literal words it was given.

### Orchestration & Controls

- **Hybrid Workflow Orchestration** — Compose workflows as finite-state machines, DAGs, or behavior trees whose nodes can be LLM agents, deterministic code, or external services. An LLM can author the topology itself from a high-level goal; once authored, the workflow runs as a structured graph rather than an open-ended agentic loop — dramatically fewer tokens per run, far more predictable and reproducible behavior, and OTP-supervised execution for every node. Use the LLM where thinking is needed, and a compiled graph everywhere else.
- **Budget-Aware with Human-in-the-Loop** — Every workflow tracks cost against configured budgets. Spending caps, permission gates, and approval steps can pause execution and hand decisions to a human reviewer before an agent commits to expensive or irreversible actions — making BullX safe to deploy for workflows that spend real money or touch regulated systems.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Elixir 1.20+, PostgreSQL, Bun

Make sure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.dev` or `.env.local` points at it.

```sh
# Bootstrap Elixir deps, JS deps, database, and assets
bun setup

# Start Phoenix and the Rsbuild development asset server
bun dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4000`.

When the local `users` table is empty, `/` redirects to `/setup`. After at least one user exists, anonymous users are sent to `/sessions/new`, and signed-in users land on the control panel at `/`.

In development, Phoenix starts Rsbuild as an endpoint watcher. The browser entry point remains `http://localhost:4000`; Rsbuild listens on `http://localhost:5173` for React/Inertia hot reload.
If those ports are already in use, set `PORT` and `RSBUILD_PORT` in `.env.local`, for example `PORT=4001` and `RSBUILD_PORT=5174`.

Useful project commands:

```sh
# Install/update JS dependencies
bun install
```

```sh
# Run the full project check used before committing
bun precommit
```

```sh
# Run frontend tests and cross-language lint checks
bun run test
bun run lint
```

## Rsbuild Asset Builds

The React/Inertia app entry is `webui/src/app.jsx`, with SPA pages under `webui/src/spas/`. For deployable assets, Rsbuild writes `priv/static/assets/.rsbuild/manifest.json`, and Phoenix resolves scripts and styles from that manifest outside development.
Run Bun from the repository root; Rsbuild uses `webui/src/` for application source and `assets/css/` for the Phoenix CSS entry.

```sh
# Build Rsbuild assets and manifest
mix assets.build

# Build production assets, including digests
mix assets.deploy
```

`mix assets.deploy` runs compilation, the Rsbuild build, and `phx.digest`. Run it before building a production release.

**Production:**

```sh
MIX_ENV=prod mix assets.deploy
MIX_ENV=prod mix release
_build/prod/rel/bullx/bin/bullx start
```

## Environment Files

BullX loads dotenv files from the repository root. Later files override earlier ones; variables already present in the OS environment take precedence over dotenv values.

| Environment | Load order |
|---|---|
| Development | `.env` → `.env.dev` → `.env.local` |
| Test | `.env` → `.env.test` |
| Production | `.env` → `.env.prod` |

> `.env.local` is gitignored and intended for machine-specific secrets. `.env`, `.env.dev`, and `.env.test` may be committed as shared non-secret team defaults.
